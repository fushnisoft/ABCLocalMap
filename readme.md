Repro for PTSS#39746

http://problemtracker.softvelocity.com/clarion9/UpdtCustBugsview.php?ID1=39746

## How:

1. Run the included EXE or compile the solution (and then run!) 
2. Click on the buttons 1, 2, 3 in turn. (Each button is set to Start a _different_ window procedure) 
3. The 3rd button will open Window2 instead of Window3

For further details, see the PTSS report or contact me and I can try to explain :)
